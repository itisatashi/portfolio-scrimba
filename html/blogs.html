                        My new journey as a Scrimba student.
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        After several months of learning in the Frontend
                        Developer Career Path, I'm continuing to improve my
                        skills through Scrimba’s interactive lessons. Every day,
                        I challenge myself with new projects, refining my coding
                        abilities and building a strong foundation for my future
                        career as a front-end developer.
                    </p>

                />

                <div class="container-long-blog">
                    <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner, always
                        exploring new ideas. As a digital economy student with a
                        strong passion for technology, I spend hours learning
                        front-end development, experimenting with code, and
                        trying to apply new techniques to my projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While that has been exciting, I realized that sharing my
                        journey could help not only me but also others who are
                        on the same path. That’s why I started documenting my
                        learning process—so I could track my progress and, at
                        the same time, contribute to the developer community.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How I got started</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started with small steps and gradually built my
                        <strong>Journey Through Code</strong> site as my
                        personal learning journal. I took notes on everything I
                        learned, whether it was a new JavaScript concept or a
                        CSS trick. After each learning session, I would reflect
                        on the key points and rewrite them in my own words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This process helped me
                        <strong>truly understand</strong> what I was learning
                        instead of just memorizing it. Over time, I saw that
                        sharing my learning summaries wasn’t just helping me—it
                        was also inspiring others who were learning to code.
                        That motivation keeps me going, pushing me to keep
                        learning, improving, and sharing my journey.
