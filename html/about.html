                            Hey there! <strong>I’m Atashi</strong>, a passionate
                            learner and aspiring front-end developer. Welcome to
                            <strong>Journey Through Code</strong>, my personal
                            learning journal where I document my growth,
                            challenges, and discoveries in the world of web
                            development.

                    <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a digital economy student with a deep interest in
                        technology, I’ve always been fascinated by how the web
                        works. To turn my passion into a career, I started
                        learning front-end development online. What began as
                        casual learning soon turned into a structured
                        journey—building projects, experimenting with code, and
                        refining my skills every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To stay consistent, I decided to share my progress.
                        Writing about what I learn helps me understand concepts
                        better, and at the same time, it might inspire others
                        who are on a similar path.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why I Created This Journal</h2>
                    <p>
                        At first, I was just taking notes for myself. But I
                        realized that documenting my experiences and lessons
                        online could be valuable—not just for me, but for anyone
                        learning to code. This journal is a space where I
                        reflect on my progress, share insights, and stay
                        motivated as I work toward becoming a front-end
                        developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re on a learning journey too, I hope my
                        experiences can encourage and support you. Let’s grow
                        together!
